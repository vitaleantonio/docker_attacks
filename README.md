# About The Project

This repository is a collection of attacks created to exploit the "sensitive" parameters of Docker, searchable in [docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/). A replication guide can be found in each directory.

The repository is organized as follows:

## Attacks replication

Replication of attacks on Docker referred to [Understanding the Security Risks of Docker Hub](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/docker.pdf).

The reference directory is [attacks_replication](https://github.com/vitaleantonio/docker_attacks/tree/main/attacks_replication).

## Novel attacks

They represent new attacks that aim to exploit "sensitive" Docker parameters and present in [new_attacks](https://github.com/vitaleantonio/docker_attacks/tree/main/new_attacks).

## A simple web server

A simple web server that allows the execution of some attacks, found in [simple_web_server](https://github.com/vitaleantonio/docker_attacks/tree/main/simple_web_server).
