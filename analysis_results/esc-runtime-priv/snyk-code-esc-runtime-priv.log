 ✗ [Medium] Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort 
   Path: cmd_with_lock.go, line 61 
   Info: The SHA1 hash (used in crypto.sha1.New) is insecure. Consider changing it to a secure hash algorithm

 ✗ [High] Path Traversal 
   Path: cmd_cpp.go, line 86 
   Info: Unsanitized input from reader flows into os.ReadFile, where it is used as a path. This may result in a Path Traversal vulnerability and allow an attacker to read arbitrary files.
